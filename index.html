		<h2>Effectiveness of Direct Sales</h2>
		<h3>Direct Selling is the best way to interact directly with the consumer. Our sales programs are designed to have our team of people become the walking talking billboard for our clients. No other advertising medium can provide the ROI and impact thata Knewsales campaign can. </h3>
		<div class="small-6 columns">
			<p>Research has shown that Consumers are more inclined to buy a product once they have been provided with the benefits of the product or service via a two-way conversation. According to a TARGET study, 80% of consumers admit that they are more likely to buy a product if they had the chance to speak to someone about it via a two way conversation.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="small-6 columns">
			<p>Also, 46% affirm that a face-to-face interaction during a promotional event helped them develop a positive image of the brand. Think of the impact! Consumers that have a positive experience with a brand will much more likely talk about it than if they simply saw a TV ad, heard it on the radio, or saw it on an outdoor billboard. The impact around the two-way conversation that takes place via our Knewsales agents can’t be matched!</p>
