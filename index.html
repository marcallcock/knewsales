			<h2>Effectiveness of Direct Sales</h2>
			<h3>Direct Selling is the best way to interact directly with the consumer. Our sales programs are designed to have our team of people become the walking talking billboard for our clients. No other advertising medium can provide the ROI and impact thata Knewsales campaign can. </h3>
			<div class="small-12 medium-6 columns">
				<p>Research has shown that Consumers are more inclined to buy a product once they have been provided with the benefits of the product or service via a two-way conversation. According to a TARGET study, 80% of consumers admit that they are more likely to buy a product if they had the chance to speak to someone about it via a two way conversation.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="small-12 medium-6 columns">
				<p>Also, 46% affirm that a face-to-face interaction during a promotional event helped them develop a positive image of the brand. Think of the impact! Consumers that have a positive experience with a brand will much more likely talk about it than if they simply saw a TV ad, heard it on the radio, or saw it on an outdoor billboard. The impact around the two-way conversation that takes place via our Knewsales agents can’t be matched!</p>

				<h4>Neil Spivack</h4>
				<span>President</span>
				<a href="">neil@knewsales.com</a>
				<p>Co-Founder, and President of Knewsales Group, Neil Spivack has been recognized in the media, through a number of publications. Among Neil's many accomplishments in 2010 Neil was nominated for the Ernst & Young Entrepreneur of the Year Award. 
				</p>
				<p>
				Neil has pioneered the way in which Direct Sales has been marketed over the past 14 years taking his skills that he learnt while being a Media Buyer for a large ad agency. Neil quickly saw that traditional media didn't provide the type of ROI that clients should receive with their advertising spend.  
				</p>
				<p>
				With this information Neil launched his first business in 2002 titled Direct Sales Force. Being ahead of the curve Neil once again pioneered the Experiential industry and launched Direct Branding Force (DBF) in 2007. Once these businesses were launched they quickly got recognized as being one of the fastest growing start up businesses of its kind in North America.
				</p>
				<p>Neil decided to continue on his path of growth by rebranding his companies with the Direct Sales company being titled Knewsales Group and the Experiential Marketing arm being Magnet Engagement Group .KSG and MEG are quickly becoming North America's largest face to face marketing companies.  </p>
				<p>Neil continues to put a strong focus around education by completing both the CAAP program at the Institute of Canadian Advertising (ICA) in 2002 and the Entrepreneurs Masters Program (EMP) that is run out of MIT in 2010. Neil has been an active member of a number of different industry associations. These include the American Marketing Association (AMA), Entrepreneurs Organization (EO) and Young Presidents Organizations (YPO).
